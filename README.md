once you're done.

3) Use modman to install the git repository for you:

4) Using composer

## Instructions for using composer

Use composer to install this extension. Before you can do this under Magento 1, you need to install the composer installer first:

    composer require magento-hackathon/magento-composer-installer

Make sure to set the `magento-root-dir` properly. Test this by running:

    composer update --no-dev

Once the composer installer is correctly setup, you can install our extension:    

    composer require yireo/magento1-googletagmanager

Done.

Bring your towel.
